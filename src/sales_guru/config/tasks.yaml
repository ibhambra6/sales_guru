prospect_research_task:
  description: >
    Enrich **ALL** HOT and WARM leads with detailed company and decision-maker information by gathering data from the web.
    For each high-priority lead, research and collect:
    1. Company information: industry, size, revenue, funding, growth trajectory, tech stack, products/services
    2. Lead name details: role, responsibilities, career history, educational background, social media presence
    3. Recent company news, press releases, or significant events
    4. Potential pain points or challenges the company might be facing
    5. Current solutions or vendors they might be using
    6. Evidence of why the lead needs your solution NOW 
    Focus on information that would be most relevant for personalized outreach and understanding potential fit.
    
    IMPORTANT TIME MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES:
    - Analyze ONLY HOT and WARM leads - completely ignore COLD leads
    - Allocate research time proportionally based on lead classification: HOT, WARM 
    - For each lead, spend no more than 2-3 web searches to gather essential information
    - If specific information is difficult to find after a reasonable effort, note it as "Information not readily available" and move on
    - Ensure ALL HOT and WARM leads receive attention - do not skip any high-priority leads
    - Focus on quality over quantity - a few highly relevant insights are more valuable than extensive general information
  expected_output: >
    A JSON-formatted list of enriched HOT and WARM lead records where each record includes:
    1. Detailed company profile with industry, size, revenue (if available), products/services
    2. Lead name insights including role details, background, and areas of responsibility
    3. Recent company developments or news that might create sales opportunities
    4. Identified pain points or challenges that your solution could address
    5. Current solutions or competitors' products they might be using
    6. Timely evidence of why the lead needs your solution NOW (based on latest news, market trends, or digital footprints)
    7. Recommended talking points for initial outreach based on the research
    The enriched data should be structured and formatted for easy consumption by the Email & Outreach Agent.
    
    For any information that could not be found after a reasonable search effort, include a note stating "Information not readily available" rather than leaving fields empty.
